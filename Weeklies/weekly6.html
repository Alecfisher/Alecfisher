<<h2>Foucault: Philosophize this! Podcast Michel Foucault pt1</h2>
<p>After hearing the podcast for this weeks Weekly, I find myself a little confused with how Foucault’s view and cybernetics connect. I do though think that he brings up an interesting point on how we as a society should value the term “power”. I think his view on control systems is pretty accurate with how our own lives work today. For society as a whole to have some sort of structure, there needs to be control on what we can and cannot do as individuals. For example, in the United States we elect a President, members of the senate and house of representatives who have more control (compared to a regular citizen) over the laws that run this country. In order for those laws to come into place, there needs to be a hierarchy of power to which can establish that control to enact them. I also agree with Foucault's stance on how prisoners should be treated - the more structure we put on their everyday tasks in prison, the less time they have to potentially break out and cause a scene. To a certain extent though, we are still human beings - and as human beings, we deserve to have some sort of freedom in our lives. We should not be chained together by higher powers for everything we do as individuals. In order for there to be an effective establishment of control within society, there also needs to be a balance of freedom that can allow us to become the individuals we want to be.

<p>Important quotes picked out from the transcript of the podcast:</p>
<p>“The people in positions of power knew that something drastic had to change if they wanted to make power more sustainable…and Foucault documents a fundamental shift that occurs in the way societies treat criminals that takes place between the years 1757 and 1837”
</p>
<p>“Foucault cites an actual strict schedule that criminals in the 1830’s serving time had to follow during their time in prison. in other words: when your ENTIRE day is scheduled and accounted for down to the second…there’s not much time for illicit criminal activity.”
</p>
<p>“The three…prongs…of this three pronged method that is used to keep prisoners in line…are what Foucault calls: Surveillence, Normalization, and Examination.”
</p>
<p>“That’s another modern invention for Foucault…thinking of ourselves as normal and the labeling of criminals as “abnormal” or people that need to be reformed to a state of normalcy.”
</p>
<p>“Foucault’s point about power is that it doesn’t matter how much money you have or how high of a political office you hold…those people may SEEM to be powerful…but if you can dictate the parameters that those people use to understand the most foundational things about their existence…if you can dictate their views on what a human being is…how they fit into the world, the vocabulary they use to think about who they are, how about being able to dictate what things even matter to them that they should then use their economic or political resources to pursue in this world…THAT’S where true power lies, to Foucault.”
