<h2>Deleuze: Postscript on the Societies of Control</h2>
<p>After reading this article, I have selected three quotations that I found extremely interesting and want to take a closer look at them.</p>
<p>“There is no need to ask which is the toughest or most tolerable regime, for it’s within each of them that liberating and enslaving forces confront each other.” (2)</p>
<p>Deleuze begins the article with enclosure and more specifically, the different levels within enclosure that prove how we believe is freedom is still a closed off space inside our disciplinary society. He uses hospitals as an example, where one may think that they are released from the borders of this healing environment, but are really still enclosed by other environments like hospis and “neighborhood clinics”. In short, we are never really free from society’s control and this article makes me believe that our only opportunity for freedom comes with a major apocalypse within the human race.
</p>
<p>“The disciplines never saw any incompatibility between [the individual and the mass], and because at the same time power individualizes and masses together, that is, constitutes those over whom it exercises power into a body and molds the individuality of each member of that body” (5).
</p>
<p>The distinction between an individual and the masses is a big issue we face in capitalistic societies today, especially in places like the United States. In major corporations, the idea of an “individual” becomes lost in the pile of large capital and instead becomes meshed with other individuals who are now characterized as one, big “mass”. Reading this part of the article was pretty eye-opening due to the way Deleuze described large corporations and the application it has on our country today.

<p>“Felix Guattari has imagined a city where one would be able to leave one's apartment, one's street, one's neighborhood, thanks to one's (dividual) electronic card that raises a given barrier; but the card could just as easily be rejected on a given day or between certain hours; what counts is not the barrier but the computer that tracks each person's position”(6).
</p>
<p>This futuristic look on the control mechanism brings enclosure to a level I would never even think to consider. At first, I read this technological advancement as a tool for ensuring our safety within large city scapes, but now understand that it is really a way for more control to be implemented on a larger scale. </p>
